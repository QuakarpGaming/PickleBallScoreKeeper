-fix formating
--happens when the score is 10+

-add a timer to the voice so it doesnt spam if we need to make corrections

-add names
--if you add names/initails to servers, make sure the score announces correctly
--team names at the top
--LATER: based on names at top update the server at the botton to reflect that
----this may need some logic, if the server name is there we need a way to 'swap' the order so if the 2nd server from start, starts the service next round, there name needs to be first
